# - Try to find MOAB headers and libraries
#
# Usage of this module as follows:
#
#     find_package(MOAB)
#
# Variables used by this module, they can change the default behavior and need
# to be set before calling find_package:
#
#  MOAB_ROOT_DIR  Set this variable to the root installation of
#                 MOAB if the module has problems finding
#                 the proper installation path.
#
# MOAB_WITH_NETCDF Set this variable to state that MOAB was built
#                  with netcdf support enabled, so we need to add the netcdf
#                  library to the link line
#
# MOAB_WITH_HDF5 Set this variable to state that MOAB was built
#                with hdf5 support enabled, so we need to add the hdf5
#                library to the link line
#
#
#
# Search Variables defined by this module:
#
#  MOAB_FOUND              System has MOAB libs/headers
#  MOAB_INCLUDE_DIRS        The location of MOAB headers
#  MOAB_LIBRARIES          The moab library to link too
