Todo:

4. correct pass by reference to be used whenever possible
6. Use a better compiler detector like boost does
7. find a better algorithm for flatten, can we use views?


Finished:

1. Switch over to boost::tuple
2. add in code to handle pre processor magic
3. add in try / compile for c++11 support to determine, what magic we should use
5. Switched over to fusion for majority of work.
