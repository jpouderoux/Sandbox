Todo:

4. correct pass by reference to be used whenever possible
5. Investigate usage of boost::fusion transformations instead
   of hand rolled code to reduce complexitiy and sources of errors.
   Will need to see if it can trim and flatten

Finished:

1. Switch over to boost::tuple
2. add in code to handle pre processor magic
3. add in try / compile for c++11 support to determine, what magic we should use
