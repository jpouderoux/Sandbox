Todo:

4. correct pass by reference to be used whenever possible
5. Investigate usage of boost::fusion. Fusion does support
   nvcc so we can properly use the library. The questions are:
   a. Fusion support flatten?
   b. Fusion support trim?
   c. I have concern that I will still need to wrap fusion calls into helper methods
6. Use a better compiler detector like boost does


Finished:

1. Switch over to boost::tuple
2. add in code to handle pre processor magic
3. add in try / compile for c++11 support to determine, what magic we should use
