A simple program that is able to dump certain information about moab files
that I was interested in looking at.

Also offers a 'simple' interface to moab that is meant to interface with vtk.

Usage: DumpTags ./file

can dump:
1. Material and Boundary Info
2. All entity sets
3. List all 3D entities
4. List all 2D entities
5. Find Root Parents
6. Find Detached Entities
