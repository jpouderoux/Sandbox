extend global generator to be given a dependency and determine
if that dependency requires a phony target or not.
Phony targets are only created for full paths that are inside the build directory
Global generator is only there to determine if a phony target has already been
generated. The calling function will have to write out the phony target it self
if not already written

Extend WriteCustomCommandBuild to call the previous function for each dependency
and write out the phony target for any that aren;t in the set

Add a test case to cmake to explicitly test this.
